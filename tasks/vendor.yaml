summary: Vendor Go dependencies.

description: |
  Go's new module system is moving the tooling away from vendoring and towards
  downloading packages from immutable proxy caches. The issue this raises with
  using tasks is tasks run in ephemeral containers, which means the module
  cache needs to be warmed on every task run.

  To get around this, the task files use a custom image, `runlog-dev`, built
  using `Dockerfile.dev`. This does the job of warming the cache and bundling
  it in the container image to be used by other tasks.

  The `runlog-dev` image is built using this task.

  If package dependencies change, the task files will have to download only
  the changes on every run. If that starts to take too long, just run this
  task again to rebuild the image and save the new dependencies.

image: docker:latest

command: docker build -t runlog-dev -f Dockerfile.dev .

arguments:
  GOOS:
    description: Platform to build for.
    default: linux
  GO111MODULE:
